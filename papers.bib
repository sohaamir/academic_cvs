In particular: We provide a uniform lower bound of the product entropy times volume that depends only on the geometry of the abstract group \(\Gamma\). We prove that the entropy is bounded from above by \(p-1\) with equality if and only if \(\rho\) is conjugate to a representation inside \({\mathrm S}({\mathrm O}(p,1)\times{\mathrm O}(q))\), which answers affirmatively to a question of Glorieux and Monclair. Lastly, we prove finiteness and compactness results for groups admitting convex cocompact representations with bounded diameter.},

	abstract = {We study the geometry of the foliation by constant Gaussian curvature surfaces \((\Sigma_k)_k\,\,\) of a hyperbolic end, and how it relates to the structures of its boundary at infinity and of its pleated boundary. First, we show that the Thurston and the Schwarzian parametrizations are the limits of two families of parametrizations of the space of hyperbolic ends, defined by Labourie in 1992 in terms of the geometry of the leaves \(\Sigma_k\). We give a new description of the renormalized volume using the constant curvature foliation. We prove a generalization of McMullen's Kleinian reciprocity theorem, which replaces the role of the Schwarzian parametrization with Labourie's parametrizations. Finally, we describe the constant curvature foliation of a hyperbolic end as the integral curve of a time-dependent Hamiltonian vector field on the cotangent space to Teichmüller space, in analogy to the Moncrief flow for constant mean curvature foliations in Lorenzian space-times.},

We show that these structures are directly related to the geometry of MGHC manifolds, via the Mess homeomorphism, the parameterization of Krasnov-Schlenker by the induced metric on \(K\)-surfaces, the identification with the cotangent bundle \(T^*{\mathcal T}(\Sigma) \), and the circle action that arises from this identification. Finally, we study the relation to the natural para-complex geometry that the space inherits from being a component of the \({\mathrm P} {\mathrm S} {\mathrm L}(2,{\mathbb B})\)-character variety, where \({\mathbb B}\,\,\) is the algebra of para-complex numbers, and the symplectic geometry deriving from Goldman symplectic form.},

	We prove that \(\rho\)-invariant pleated surfaces are always embedded, acausal, and possess an intrinsic pseudo-metric and a hyperbolic structure. We describe the latter by constructing a shear cocycle from the cross ratio naturally associated to \(\rho\). The process developed to this purpose applies to a wide class of cross ratios, including examples arising from Hitchin and \(\Theta\)-positive representations in \({\mathrm S}{\mathrm O}(p,q)\). We also show that the length spectrum of \(\rho\,\,\) dominates the ones of \(\rho\)-invariant pleated surfaces, with strict inequality exactly on curves that intersect the bending locus.
	We observe that the canonical decomposition of a \(\rho\)-invariant pleated surface into leaves and plaques corresponds to a decomposition of the Guichard-Wienhard domain of discontinuity of \(\rho\,\,\) into standard fibered blocks, namely triangles and lines of photons. Conversely, we give a concrete construction of photon manifolds fibering over hyperbolic surfaces by gluing together triangles of photons.
	The tools we develop allow to recover various results by Collier, Tholozan, and Toulisse on the (pseudo-Riemannian) geometry of \(\rho\,\,\) and on the correspondence between maximal representations and fibered photon manifolds through a constructive and geometric approach, bypassing the use of Higgs
	bundles.},

Differential Geom. 50 (1998) 25–58) expresses the derivative of the volume of the convex cores \((C M_t)_t\,\,\) in terms of the variation of the geometry of their boundaries, as the classical Schläfli formula (Q. J. Pure Appl. Math. 168 (1858) 269–301) does for the volume of hyperbolic polyhedra. Here we study the analogous problem for the dual volume, a notion that arises from the polarity relation between the hyperbolic space \({\mathbb H}^3\,\,\) and the de Sitter space \({\mathrm d}{\mathbb S}^3\). The corresponding dual Bonahon–Schläfli formula has been originally deduced from Bonahon’s work by Krasnov and Schlenker (Duke Math. J. 150 (2009) 331–356). Applying the differential Schläfli formula (Electron. Res. Announc. Amer. Math. Soc. 5 (1999) 18–23) and the properties of the dual volume, we give a (almost) self-contained proof of the dual Bonahon–Schläfli formula, without making use of Bonahon’s results.},

One of the main results [Theorem 20, arXiv:0707.2151] was the possibility to select one distinguished operator (up to scalar multiplication) for every choice of a surface \(S\), ideal triangulations \(\lambda, \lambda'\,\,\) and isomorphic local representations \(\rho, \rho'\), requiring that the whole family of operators verifies certain Fusion and Composition properties. By analyzing the constructions of arXiv:0707.2151, we found a difficulty that we eventually fix by a slightly weaker (but actually optimal) selection procedure. In fact, for every choice of a surface \(S\), ideal triangulations \(\lambda, \lambda'\,\,\) and isomorphic local representations \(\rho, \rho'\), we select a finite set of intertwining operators, naturally endowed with a structure of affine space over \(H_1(S;{\mathbb Z}_N) \,\) (\({\mathbb Z}_N \,\,\) is the cyclic group of order \(N\)), in such a way that the whole family of operators verifies augmented Fusion and Composition properties, which incorporate the explicit behavior of the \({\mathbb Z}_N\)-actions with respect to such properties. Moreover, this family is minimal among the collections of operators verifying the weak Fusion and Composition rules (in practice the ones considered in arXiv:0707.2151). In addition, we adapt the derivation of the invariants for pseudo-Anosov diffeomorphisms and their hyperbolic mapping tori made in arXiv:0707.2151 and arXiv:math/0407086 by using our distinguished family of intertwining operators.},
