## Academic CVs ðŸ“– 

Code for two versions of my academic CV written in LaTeX. 

The 'classic' CV is the version most often used by academics, with text written in the Computer Modern font. I initially used a template openly made available by Priya Bhatia found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1eutEE9IBsZSFh8FZzas6pt4ahsxH8GB0?usp=share_link), adding my own sections and making specific visual changes such as adding my relevant academic profiles and logos.

The 'modern CV' uses a different template, one provided by Dario Taraborelli implementing the Linux Libertine O font, freely available on his [website](https://nitens.org/w/cvtex/). Again, I made some 
additional changes such as including my academic profiles/logos and changing the size and font of specific features (e.g., subheaders). Note: in order to use the Linux Libertine O font, you must first download it onto your machine, which you can do [here](https://www.cufonfonts.com/font/linux-libertine-o)
