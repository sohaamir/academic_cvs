Code for two versions of my academic CV written in LaTeX. 

The 'classic' CV is the version often used by academics, featuring Computer Modern font. I initially used a template openly made availabel by Priya Bhatia found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1eutEE9IBsZSFh8FZzas6pt4ahsxH8GB0?usp=share_link), adding my own sections and making specific visual changes such as adding my academic profiles and logos.

The 'modern CV' uses a different template, one provided by Dario Taraborelli implementing the Linux Libertine font, freely available on his [website](https://nitens.org/w/cvtex/). Again, I made some 
additional changes such as adding my academic profiles and changing the size and font of specific features. Note: in order to use the Linux Libertine font, you must first download it onto your machine.
