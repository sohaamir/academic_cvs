## My Academic CVs

Here is code for three versions of my CV, all written in LaTeX. Why three versions you may ask? I firstly created by CV using the 'classic' style with Computer Modern font, before discovering a more 'modern' version using Linux Libertine O as the font. After writing that version, I discovered the 'Prometheus' template, which was even more attractive, so I decided to stick with that (for now).

### Classic LaTeX CV

My classic LaTeX CV was built using a template provided by Priya Bhatia, which you can find [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1eutEE9IBsZSFh8FZzas6pt4ahsxH8GB0).

### Dario CV

The version using Linux Libertine O as it's font was written by [Dario Taraborelli](https://github.com/dartar), which you can find on his [personal website](https://nitens.org/w/cvtex/). More instructions can also be found on his [GitHub page](https://github.com/dartar/cvtex).

### Prometheus CV

The 'Prometheus CV' was made by Christian Bock which you can find [here](https://github.com/chrisby/prometheusCV) for instructions, although I used [this version](https://github.com/filippomazzoli/academic-CV) forked from the initial repository by Filippo Mazzoli.
